# Scrum — Battle of Britain Linux Native Port

Scrum project management for completing the native Linux port of Rowan's *Battle of
Britain* (2000). This file is the **single source of agile truth**: backlog, sprints,
ceremonies, and Definition of Done. It rides on top of the engineering record — the
running technical log is `PORT.md` (newest-first, with evidence) and the high-level state
snapshot is `STATUS.md`. When a backlog item moves, update its checkbox here and append the
evidence to `PORT.md`.

---

## 1. Product Vision

> A faithful, native Linux build of *Battle of Britain* that boots to its real menu on one
> window and lets a player start, fly, and complete a mission through the game's own flow —
> with terrain, clouds, cockpit, sound, and keyboard all live — **with no `BOB_*` env
> vars** — i.e. it plays the way it did on Windows, minus music (environment-blocked) and
> multiplayer (out of scope).

The constraint that shapes everything: **game sources stay unedited**. All work lives in
`SRC/compat/` and the `BOB_*`-gated boot scaffolds. The port maps Win32/MFC/DX7/DInput/
DSound onto SDL2 + OpenGL + OpenAL.

---

## 2. The Epic

> **EPIC: Complete the port of BoB to Linux.**
>
> Collapse the separate env-gated bring-up scaffolds (front-end, 3D flight, audio) into the
> game's own continuous end-to-end loop, running with real initialization and no diagnostic
> env gates, on a single window.

The epic decomposes into the five phases already identified in `STATUS.md`. Scrum maps each
phase to one or more **Sprints**, each delivering a **shippable increment** (a runnable
`./bob` that demonstrably does more of the real flow than the previous increment).

---

## 3. Roles

| Scrum role | Who | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| **Product Owner** | The user (`curator`) | Orders the backlog, accepts increments, owns "done". |
| **Scrum Master** | Claude (this agent) | Removes blockers, keeps ceremonies, protects the no-edit-game-code + no-real-email conventions. |
| **Development Team** | Claude (autonomous per CLAUDE.md working mode) | Builds increments in `SRC/compat/`, logs evidence in `PORT.md`. |

Working agreement (from `CLAUDE.md`): work autonomously, don't pause for confirmation, pick
the idiomatic Linux/POSIX path, only stop on a hard blocker. Anonymous repo — commit as
`curator <noreply@anthropic.com>`.

---

## 4. Definition of Ready (DoR)

A backlog item is *Ready* to enter a sprint when:
- It has a clear acceptance criterion that is **observable by running `./bob`** (a trace
  line, a frame dump, a non-black ground %, an exit code, an audible/visible state).
- Its reproduction command (env vars + data path) is written down.
- Dependencies (earlier stories) are done or explicitly stubbed.

## 5. Definition of Done (DoD)

A backlog item is *Done* when **all** hold:
1. Implemented in `SRC/compat/` (or a `BOB_*` boot scaffold) — **no game-logic edits**.
2. `cd build && ninja bob` links clean.
3. Default `./bob` still exits 0 (no regression to the safe default path).
4. The acceptance criterion is demonstrated with reproducible evidence.
5. A dated entry is appended to `PORT.md` (newest on top) with the evidence.
6. Any new diagnostic is **env-gated and default-off**.
7. `STATUS.md` "What works" / roadmap updated if the item changes product state.

**Increment-level DoD (per sprint):** the above for every story in the sprint **plus** the
sprint's increment is independently runnable and represents a faithful step toward the
no-env-var end state.

## 6. Product Backlog

Ordered by Product-Owner value/risk. Estimates in **story points** (Fibonacci; 1≈trivial,
13≈multi-session research grind). Status: ☐ To Do · ◐ In Progress · ☑ Done.

### Already shipped (Sprint 0 — pre-Scrum increments, accepted)
These landed before formal Scrum and are the baseline increment. Listed for velocity
calibration and so we don't re-do them.

| ID | Story | Pts | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| S0.1 | Build/link all 16 modules + MFC → ELF; default `./bob` exits 0 | 8 | ☑ |
| S0.2 | 3D flight + cockpit on real GL (`BOB_BOOT_FRONTEND`) | 13 | ☑ |
| S0.3 | Landscape ground via FBO RTT (default-on, 51%→99% non-black) | 13 | ☑ |
| S0.4 | FULL_RES land textures + fluffy clouds by default | 5 | ☑ |
| S0.5 | Audio DirectSound→OpenAL (engine loop + effects) | 13 | ☑ |
| S0.6 | Keyboard flight input (SDL→DIK→DInput→command) | 8 | ☑ |
| S0.7 | HUD info bar + unit-factor (`SetUnits`) divide-by-zero fix | 3 | ☑ |
| S0.8 | Front-end: hosted R\* OLE controls, config forms, RLE8 backgrounds | 13 | ☑ |

**Baseline velocity reference:** ~25–30 pts of accepted work per "session-sprint".

### Release 1 — "Real boot, one window" (Phases 1–2)

| ID | Story (As a player / dev, I want…) | Pts | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| R1.1a | **Unify the window — infrastructure.** *Verified already done:* one `SDL_CreateWindow`/GL context, one event pump, both present paths (`present_surface` flight + `bob_gdi_present` front-end) swap the same `g_win`. | 3 | ☑ |
| R1.1b | **Unify the window — control flow.** Merge the two mutually-exclusive `InitInstance` forks (`BOB_BOOT_FRONTEND` vs `BOB_FRONTEND`) + collapse the `Run()` wait-strategy branches into one continuous menu→fly→menu app. **Blocked-by R1.3** (flight-under-real-init corrupts the heap). Re-estimated up; carried to Sprint 2. | 8 | ☐ |
| R1.2 | **Diagnose the gating heap corruption:** get a memory tool (valgrind memcheck under `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy`/software-GL, or ASan on suspect TUs) onto the `InitPreferences` combat path; capture the first invalid write. | 13 | ☑ |
| R1.3a | **Fix `SetPilotedAcAnim`** scalar `delete`→`delete[]` (alloc-dealloc-mismatch). Verified gone under ASan; default flight unregressed. | 3 | ☑ |
| R1.3b | **Bound `Reg3dConv`** scancode/shiftstate indices + terminator read (2-byte WRITE 1207 B past `KeyMap3d`). Verified gone under ASan. | 2 | ☑ |
| R1.3c | **Pin bilinear after `InitPreferences`** (trilinear default → `CopyMapToSurface` NULL-deref). Verified: loader SEGV gone, InitPreferences reaches live flight. | 2 | ☑ |
| R1.3d | **Transient double-free** in `RemoveDeadListFromWorld` — `TransientItem::operator delete` re-ran the destructor (delete-expression idiom) → anim buffer freed twice. Fixed to `::operator delete(obj)`. ASan: gone; flight 90s clean. | 8 | ☑ |
| R1.4 | **Land real init via `InitPreferences()`:** wired as default; per-feature `BOB_*` forces retired (gated `!initPrefs` / kept as overrides). `BOB_NOINITPREFS` reverts. | 5 | ☑ |
| R1.5 | **Regression sweep:** verified — default flight reaches View3d interactive, 90s clean, 92% non-black frame, OpenAL engine loop + effects, HUD on, no feature env vars. | 3 | ☑ |

### Release 2 — "Play a mission" (Phase 3)

| ID | Story | Pts | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| R2.1 | **Menu "Fly" drives the real mission load** (`LoadSetPiece`) instead of the synthesized scramble. | 13 | ☐ |
| R2.2 | **Mission-end → debrief** path runs through the game's own flow. | 8 | ☐ |
| R2.3 | **Latent uninitialized-state bug grind** uncovered by the real mission loop (expect several; each a sub-task logged in `PORT.md`). | 13 | ☐ |
| R2.4 | **Campaign continuity:** menu → mission → fly → debrief → next, no env vars. | 8 | ☐ |

### Release 3 — "Faithful & complete" (Phases 4–5)

| ID | Story | Pts | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| R3.1 | Joystick via `DI_EnumDevices` (needs `/dev/input/js*` hardware to verify). | 5 | ☐ |
| R3.2 | Save/load round-trip through the real menu. | 5 | ☐ |
| R3.3 | Intro Smacker video playback. | 5 | ☐ |
| R3.4 | Front-end blit subsystem (combo box-art/dropdown arrows) + DPI/font pass. | 8 | ☐ |
| R3.5 | Deferred render fidelity: mirror horizon UV sanitiser, trilinear mipmap upload, terrain detail combiner. | 8 | ☐ |

### Icebox (out of scope / environment-blocked — not scheduled)
| ID | Story | Why parked |
|---|---|---|
| ICE.1 | MIDI music (`midiOut*` → soft-synth) | **Env blocker:** no 32-bit fluidsynth / soft-synth; needs an environment change first. |
| ICE.2 | DirectPlay multiplayer | Large, low priority — out of scope per DoD vision. |

## 7. Sprint Plan

Sprints are scoped to ~one focused work-session each, ~20–30 pts (calibrated to Sprint-0
velocity). Each sprint ends with a **shippable increment**: a `./bob` that does strictly
more of the real flow.

### Sprint 1 — "One window, real init begins" → *Increment: unified-window build*
- **Sprint Goal:** the front-end and flight share one continuous GL window, and the heap
  corruption that blocks real init is **diagnosed** (first invalid write captured).
- **Committed:** R1.1 (8), R1.2 (13). *Total 21 pts.*
- **Increment demo:** `./bob` opens one window, navigates menu, enters flight on the *same*
  window; a `PORT.md` entry pins the memory-tool finding for the corruption.
- **Risk:** R1.2 is research — if valgrind can't run under GL, the fallback (ASan on suspect
  TUs / `-fpack-struct` A-B build) is the Scrum-Master's blocker-removal task.

### Sprint 2 — "Real init lands" → **CLOSED 2026-06-17 (partial; Release 1 slips to Sprint 3)**
- **Delivered (PO-accepted, 7 pts):** R1.3a/b/c — setup-layer heap corruption fixed & ASan-verified;
  InitPreferences reaches live flight; default flight unregressed. Increment = the corruption-fix build.
- **Not delivered:** R1.4/R1.5 — blocked by **R1.3d** (transient double-free, discovered mid-sprint;
  InitPreferences-specific, gates init-as-default). PO chose to ship the verified increment and split
  R1.3d into a focused Sprint 3 rather than grind an uncertain multi-session bug.
- **Carried to Sprint 3:** R1.3d (8), R1.4 (5), R1.5 (3).

### Sprint 3 — "Crack the transient double-free, land init" → *Increment: env-free boot to flight* — **NEXT**
- **Sprint Goal:** fix R1.3d so combat under InitPreferences is heap-clean, then land InitPreferences as
  the default init (R1.4) with the regression sweep (R1.5). **Ships Release 1.**
- **Committed (16 pts):** R1.3d (8), R1.4 (5), R1.5 (3).
- **Tooling ready:** `BOB_ASAN` build (consider adding `-g` for line numbers on the destructor aliasing);
  valgrind memcheck for the uninitialised-value cross-check.
- **Note:** the original Sprint-3 mission-loop work (R2.1/R2.2) shifts one sprint later.

### Sprint 2 (original plan, superseded by the CLOSED block above)
- **Sprint Goal:** `InitPreferences()` is the real default init; flight runs faithfully with
  **no `BOB_*` Save_Data forces**.
- **Committed (PO-approved, 16 pts):** R1.3 (8), R1.4 (5), R1.5 (3). R1.1b deferred to Sprint 3.
- **R1.3 broken out (from the R1.2 diagnosis):**
  - R1.3a — `shape::SetPilotedAcAnim`: scalar `delete` → `delete[]` (match `SetAnimData`'s `new[]`).
  - R1.3b — `keytests::Reg3dConv`: bound the index / size the table to the real `FileNum` range.
  - R1.3c — InitPreferences's trilinear default → `CopyMapToSurface` NULL-deref: pin `filtering`=BILINEAR
    in the boot scaffold after `InitPreferences` (the deep trilinear mipmap-upload fix stays deferred → R3.5).
- **PO decision (Sprint-2 planning):** R1.3a/b done as a **minimal documented game-code exception** to the
  "sources stay unedited" rule — root-cause UB fixes (~2 lines), each logged in PORT.md with ASan evidence.
  (Rejected: compat-side global-operator mitigation — invasive, leaves the UB latent.)
- **Increment demo:** `BOB_RUN_INIT=1 BOB_DRIVE_C=… ./bob` reaches flight with terrain/
  clouds/cockpit/sound/HUD live and zero feature-forcing env vars.
- **Ships Release 1.**

### Sprint 3 — "Fly a real mission" → *Increment: menu-driven mission*
- **Sprint Goal:** the real menu "Fly" loads a real mission (`LoadSetPiece`) and the player
  flies it; mission-end reaches debrief.
- **Committed:** R2.1 (13), R2.2 (8). *Total 21 pts.*
- **Increment demo:** from the menu, start a mission, fly it, see the debrief — through the
  game's own flow.

### Sprint 4 — "Campaign loop closes" → *Increment: end-to-end campaign*
- **Sprint Goal:** menu → mission → fly → debrief → next, stable, no env vars; the
  uninitialized-state bug tail is cleared.
- **Committed:** R2.3 (13), R2.4 (8). *Total 21 pts.*
- **Increment demo:** complete two consecutive missions through the real flow.
- **Ships Release 2 — this satisfies the Definition of Done vision.**

### Sprint 5+ — "Faithful & complete" → *Increment: polish + peripherals*
- **Sprint Goal:** peripherals and fidelity polish.
- **Backlog:** R3.1–R3.5, pulled by Product-Owner priority. ~31 pts → likely 2 sprints.
- **Ships Release 3.**

> **Music (ICE.1)** stays in the icebox until the environment provides a 32-bit synth; it is
> explicitly excluded from the Definition of Done.

## 8. Ceremonies

Adapted to an autonomous single-agent cadence (a "session" = a sprint):

- **Sprint Planning** (start of session): pull the top Ready stories up to the velocity
  budget; write the Sprint Goal here.
- **Daily Standup** (per work-batch): not a meeting — a one-line progress note. Surfaces in
  the agent's running narration; blockers escalate immediately (autonomous working mode).
- **Sprint Review** (end of session): demo the increment by running `./bob`; Product Owner
  accepts against the DoD. Record acceptance in `PORT.md`.
- **Sprint Retrospective** (end of session): one "what to improve" note appended below.

## 9. Burndown / Velocity Tracking

| Sprint | Committed pts | Done pts | Increment shipped? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 (pre-Scrum) | — | ~76 | ✅ baseline | Calibration baseline. |
| 1 | 21 | 16 | ✅ accepted | PO-accepted as Done (Sprint Review, 2026-06-17). R1.2 (13) done; R1.1 split → R1.1a (3) done, R1.1b (8, re-est.) blocked-by R1.3, carried. Tooling: `BOB_ASAN` build + valgrind memcheck (cross-validated R1.2) added. |
| 2 | 16 | 7 | ⚠️ partial | Shipped R1.3a/b/c (setup corruption fixed; InitPreferences reaches flight). R1.3d (transient double-free, NEW) gates init-as-default → R1.4/R1.5 + R1.3d split to Sprint 3. **Release 1 slips to Sprint 3.** PO-accepted the corruption-fix increment. |
| 3 | 16 | 16 | ✅ **Release 1 shipped** | R1.3d (transient double-free root-caused + fixed), R1.4 (InitPreferences = default init), R1.5 (regression: faithful flight, no feature env vars). Full commit delivered. |
| 4 | 8 | — | ⏸ in progress (spike done) | **ACTIVE (2026-06-17):** R1.1b (control-flow merge). SPIKE COMPLETE: Run() loop already unified; the merge is really the front-end's own `StartFlying()→Rtestsh1→OnFlyingClosed` bring-up, which converges with R2.1. **Implementation not started — awaiting PO direction** (fold into R2.1 / minimal scaffold transition / start StartFlying bring-up). See PORT.md. R2.1/R2.2 → Sprint 5. |
| 5+ | ~31 | — | — | Polish/peripherals. |

Update the **Done pts** column at each Sprint Review; that's the running velocity.

## 10. Retrospective Log
*(Newest on top. One improvement note per sprint.)*

- _Sprint 3:_ **Splitting R1.3d out (Sprint 2 decision) paid off — focused, it cracked in one session.** The
  multi-session "uncrackable" transient double-free fell quickly once given (a) `-g` line numbers on the ASan
  build and (b) undivided focus instead of being one item in a crowded story. Lesson: when a bug resists,
  the unblock is often *better tooling + isolation*, not more effort — and that's worth a deliberate
  re-scope. Kept well: invest in tooling early (the `-g` addition turned an inlined `??:?` stack into the
  exact `operator delete` line). Estimation note: R1.3d came in at ~8 as estimated; the corruption onion
  bottomed out at four bugs total — the Sprint-1 spike lesson would have sized R1.3 closer to 15 up front.
- _Sprint 2:_ **A "fix the corruption" story hid layers; fixing one peeled back the next.** R1.3 looked
  like one bug but was three (setup mismatch, OOB write, trilinear) plus a deeper combat-loop double-free
  that only surfaced *once the setup fixes let combat run*. Lesson: corruption stories are onion-shaped —
  estimate them as spikes, not fixed-size fixes, and expect each fix to reveal the next under the tool.
  Kept well: ASan-verify each fix immediately (caught that R1.3b's write was fixed but a read remained);
  A/B with/without the trigger to classify bugs (default-vs-InitPreferences split told us which bug
  actually gates the goal). Process win: surfacing the scope fork to the PO instead of silently grinding
  an uncertain multi-session bug — banked verified value and kept the default path stable.
- _Sprint 1:_ **Estimate the work before committing the points.** R1.1 ("unify the window", 8 pts) was
  mis-sized in two directions at once — the infra was *already done* (over-estimated) while the real
  remaining work (control-flow merge) is bigger *and* blocked-by a later story (R1.3). A 1-pt spike to read
  the seam before Sprint Planning would have caught both. Action: add a Definition-of-Ready "spike unknowns
  first" check for architecture-touching stories. Upside: ASan-as-tool (when valgrind is absent) was a clean
  unblock for the critical-path story — keep the "verify the tool exists before committing the approach" habit.

## 11. Risk Register

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Heap corruption (R1.2/R1.3) is a deep `-fpack-struct` grind | High | Blocks Release 1 | Memory tooling first; A/B `-fpack-struct` per-TU; class-match prior overrun fixes. |
| Real mission loop unearths a long tail of uninit-state bugs | High | Slows Release 2 | Budgeted as R2.3 (13 pts); each bug a logged sub-task, same pattern as `SetUnits`/volume fixes. |
| valgrind can't run under real GL | Medium | Slows R1.2 | `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy` / software GL fallback (already noted in STATUS.md). |
| Game-code edit pressure when a fix "wants" to live in game logic | Medium | Violates core constraint | Hard rule: solve in `SRC/compat/` or boot scaffold; cap the compat layer instead. |
| No joystick hardware to verify R3.1 | Medium | Can't accept R3.1 | Implement against `SDL_NumJoysticks`; mark accepted-on-hardware. |
| MIDI music environment blocker | Certain | Music absent | Iceboxed; excluded from DoD; revisit only after environment change. |
