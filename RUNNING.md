# Battle of Britain — Run & Check Progress

## Run the game

```bash
cd "/home/admin/sgl/TUE/BattleOfBritain/WP/drive_c/Program Files/Rowan Software/Battle Of Britain"
BOB_RUN_INIT=1 BOB_FRONTEND=1 BOB_OLE_DRAW=1 /home/admin/bob/build/bob
```

That is the real front-end (menus, config screens, campaign strategic map, fly).
Alternative: `BOB_BOOT_FRONTEND=1 /home/admin/bob/build/bob` jumps straight into
a Quick-Mission cockpit. Requires a healthy GL display session.

Rebuild: `cd /home/admin/bob/build && ninja bob`.

## Check progress

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Backlog (Releases R1–R7 + SP) + burndown | `scrum.md` — Release SP is the screen-parity epic; §9 burndown |
| Per-gold-shot parity verdicts | `doc/screen-parity.md` — currently 14 CLOSE / 2 PARTIAL / 3 GAP of 19 |
| Side-by-side captures | `doc/parity/` |
| Engineering evidence log (newest first) | `PORT.md` |
| Live product snapshot | `STATUS.md` |
| History | `git log --oneline` on `linux-port` |

Gold standard: `/run/media/admin/BEA6-BBCE/bob/` (19 PNGs). Oracle ruling: the
gold shots as-is = the BDG 0.99 patched build (dialogs/strings read from
`boblang.dll` PE resources since S124; `BOB_NO_PE_RSRC=1` reverts).

## Current state (2026-07-26)

- S124 closed (`6f82c00`): PE resource layer, all 8 config tabs CLOSE vs gold.
- S125 closed (`533aba9`): enter-name CLOSE, phase-select column spread fixed.
- S126 salvaged mid-flight (`9105e25`): property-stream reader across all hosted
  control types — compiles clean, **pixel-diff verification incomplete**; re-run
  the 14-recipe sweep before building on it.
- GL-gated: the default-run exit-0 DoD gate + flight captures — waiting on a
  healthy display session (headless SDL-dummy proxy shows no startup regression).
